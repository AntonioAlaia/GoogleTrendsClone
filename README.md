# Right-wing extremism on Google Italia searches during COVID-19 pandemic

## Data Access Capstone Project 2022 📍

### Research question 🔎
Did COVID-19 pandemic period increased the italian right-wing extremism online presence?
Did right-wing related keywords spread on Italian Google searches during the pandemic?
Inspired by a [Rovetta A. study published on JMIR](https://infodemiology.jmir.org/2021/1/e29929/), the aim of this project is testing the hypothesis claiming that the volume of researches on Google Italia about right-wing extremism topics, actors, websites and news has raised during the pandemic.
